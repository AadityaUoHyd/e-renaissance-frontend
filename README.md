# Major Pending works to do in future.

2. Delete button for instructor to delete video courses.
3. Billing using Razorpay for Indian student, right now it has only Paypal option (dollars).
4. Arcjet implemenetation to keep it safe from bots.
6. Profile Page (where user can upload personal display pic).
5. Need to make more smooth experience for students who will watch video lectures (UI customization in ViewStudentCourseProgessPage. e.g. Mark/toggle all courses as completed or not-completed, blackout in video after free preview due to onProgessUpdate() methods is not suppose to execute but it is executing due to StudentViewCourseProgressPage has next video play feature).
6. Dark/light mode hero images changes.
